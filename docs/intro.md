# About

Rodux Utils is a collection of utilities for projects using Rodux. It tries to
address some of the most common problems Rodux users have by dipping into the
Redux ecosystem for some inspiration. Some problems Rodux Utils aims to solve
are:

- Dealing with Immutable data
- Organizing your Rodux code
- Deriving data from state

We're going to discuss how exactly we can solve these problems on the following
pages.
